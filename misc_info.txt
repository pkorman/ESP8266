//guide how to not publish passwords on git
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/40411/hiding-wlan-password-when-pushing-to-github

I created a placeholder credentials.h file with the following info (Edger's answer).

#ifndef CREDENTIALS_H
#define CREDENTIALS_H

// Replace with your actual SSID and password:
#define WIFI_SSID "Your SSID here"
#define WIFI_PASSWD "WLAN AP password here"

#endif

I further added the reference to this new file in the .ino file.

#include "credentials.h"

const char ssid[] = WIFI_SSID;
const char pass[] = WIFI_PASSWD;

Now the twist.. I excluded the file from being checked for changes using the --assume-unchanged command.

    git update-index --assume-unchanged credentials.h

You can then modify the credentials.h file and wont be prompted to add it to github.

Note, to re-check the file use --no-assume-unchanged.
